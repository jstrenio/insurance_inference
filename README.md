# insurance_inference

This project was completed to experience going from raw business data to an actionable and easily accessible deployed model endpoint, an end-to-end
machine learning pipeline. the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction/version/1) is comprised of 
information on current insurance policy holders and attempts to determine whether to pursue them as vehicle insurance customers as well. The deployed
model [can be tested easily by anyone here](https://insurance-inference.herokuapp.com/index) and demonstrates the successful use of ML in business
analytics.
